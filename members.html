											<h2>Chris Willott [PI]</h2>
																						<h3>Canadian Astronomy Data Centre | Victoria, Canada</h3>
											<p>Chris Willott is an astronomer with the Canadian Astronomy Data Centre in Victoria, Canada. He studies the evolution of galaxies and black holes in the early Universe. He is most excited to see what surprises the James Webb Space Telescope throws at us. In his spare time, Chris likes to study tiny underwater creatures such as nudibranchs.</p>

											<h2>Roberto Abraham</h2>
                                            <h3>University of Toronto | Toronto, Canada</h3>
											<p>Roberto Abraham is a Professor of Astronomy and Chair of the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy and Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and served as President of the Canadian Astronomical Society. He is most excited about seeing somebody use JWST to discover how massive black holes form very early in the history of the Universe (they shouldn’t be there but are!). Plus, what reionized the Universe? (Betcha it’s little galaxies, but maybe it’s the black holes that shouldn’t exist). Also, dark matter, what the hell? His hobby is amateur astronomy, which demonstrates a very sad lack of imagination.</p>

											<!-- <p>John Hutchings is an emeritus researcher at the DAO. He helped wangle Canada’s participation in JWST back in the 1990s and was a project scientist until delivery of the Canadian instruments - when the launch date was imminent in 2012. His interests are active galaxies and high-energy objects generally and have published a ton of such papers over the years. Happy to be around to see the thing finally get off the ground, and change human thinking forever. He writes trashy adventure novels and enjoys doing interesting things with smart people all over the world. Also food and wine. Cheers.</p> -->

											<p>Visal Sok is a PhD candidate at York University in Toronto. His research focuses on the evolution of galaxies at cosmic noon, and in particular, understanding what causes clumpy star formation in these galaxies. With JWST, he is excited to see whether the same physical processes drive star formation in more distant galaxies. While not pondering about the origin of clumpy galaxies, he decompresses at the gym and is learning to play the guitar.</p>

											<p>Victoria Strait is a DAWN Fellow at the Cosmic Dawn Center within the Niels Bohr Institute at the University of Copenhagen. She studies the properties of lensed galaxies at high redshift, during and after the Epoch of Reionization, and enjoys working with students and teaching. In free time she enjoys climbing and hiking. </p>

											<h2>Vivian Tan</h2>
                                            <h3>York University | Toronto, Canada</h3>
											<p>Vivian Tan is a PhD Candidate at York University in Toronto. Her research interests focus on the mass assembly histories of Milky Way mass galaxies, especially how the progenitors of Milky Way-like galaxies formed and built up their stellar masses, and changed in morphology over time. Now that JWST can resolve even very small galaxies at high redshift, she is eager to see whether observations of Milky Way progenitors in the early universe matches up with simulations of Milky Way growth. In her spare time, Vivian likes to read novels, draw comics, and write stories.</p>

											<h2>Roberta Tripodi</h2>
                                            <h3>University of Ljubljana | Ljubljana, Slovenia</h3>
											<p>Roberta Tripodi is a post-doctoral researcher at the University of Ljubljana. She is mainly interested in the evolution of AGNs and their host galaxies at high-z. In particular, during her PhD she used the powerful capabilities of ALMA to investigate the QSO-host evolution at z>6. She is now very excited to work with JWST and CANUCS, since she aims to explore low-mass and low-luminosity AGNs at high-z. Roberta is also bookaholic, especially fantasy books, and loves long walks in the nature.</p>

                                            <h3>Saint Mary's University | Halifax, Canada</h3>
											<p>Johannes Zabl is a post-doctoral fellow at Saint Mary's University in Halifax, Canada. He studies distant galaxies and their surrounding circumgalactic medium to understand how gas flows regulate galaxy evolution. With JWST, he hopes to get novel insights into these processes, both in individual galaxies and statistical samples. In his off time, he likes to cycle/run or take pictures of the world. </p>
